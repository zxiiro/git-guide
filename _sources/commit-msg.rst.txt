Deeper look into commits
========================

Despite being the core function of Git, folks new to Git often ignore the
importance of understanding
:ref:`Commit Objects <building-blocks:Commit object>` and how they interact
with the entire Git system.

One important overlooked feature of it is the Commit Message, often times
commits with poorly defined messages are created and submitted to Git repos
that make it difficult to later troubleshoot or sometimes automate tasks with
Git.

In this section we will take a deeper dive into Git Objects themselves as well
as explore what makes a great **Commit Message** when preparing a commit for
public review.

7 rules of a great commit message
---------------------------------

The below discussion references
https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/#seven-rules

1. :ref:`commit-msg:Separate subject from body with a blank line`
2. :ref:`commit-msg:Limit the subject line to 50 characters`
3. :ref:`commit-msg:Capitalize the subject line`
4. :ref:`commit-msg:Do not end the subject line with a period`
5. :ref:`commit-msg:Use the imperative mood in the subject line`
6. :ref:`commit-msg:Wrap the body at 72 characters`
7. :ref:`commit-msg:Use the body to explain what and why vs. how`

.. code-block:: none

    Summarize changes in around 50 characters or less

    More detailed explanatory text, if necessary. Wrap it to about 72
    characters or so. In some contexts, the first line is treated as the
    subject of the commit and the rest of the text as the body. The
    blank line separating the summary from the body is critical (unless
    you omit the body entirely); various tools like `log`, `shortlog`
    and `rebase` can get confused if you run the two together.

    Explain the problem that this commit is solving. Focus on why you
    are making this change as opposed to how (the code explains that).
    Are there side effects or other unintuitive consequences of this
    change? Here's the place to explain them.

    Further paragraphs come after blank lines.

     - Bullet points are okay, too

     - Typically a hyphen or asterisk is used for the bullet, preceded
       by a single space, with blank lines in between, but conventions
       vary here

    If you use an issue tracker, put references to them at the bottom,
    like this:

    Signed-off-by: First Last <email>


Separate subject from body with a blank line
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

From the ``git commit`` manpage:

    Though not required, itâ€™s a good idea to begin the commit message with a
    single short (less than 50 character) line summarizing the change,
    followed by a blank line and then a more thorough description. The text up
    to the first blank line in a commit message is treated as the commit
    title, and that title is used throughout Git. For example,
    Git-format-patch(1) turns a commit into email, and it uses the title on
    the Subject line and the rest of the commit in the body.

Similar to email, a commit message has a subject line and a body which
is separated by a blank line. Do not write your entire commit message in the
subject line.


Limit the subject line to 50 characters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

50 characters is a general rule of thumb. Think of emails, do not write
your entire commit message in just the subject line.


Capitalize the subject line
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``Update lint configuration for Molecule v3`` is better than
``update lint section for Molecule v3``.


Do not end the subject line with a period
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``Update lint configuration for Molecule v3`` is better than
``Update lint configuration for Molecule v3.``


Use the imperative mood in the subject line
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In support of the rule to
:ref:`commit-msg:Limit the subject line to 50 characters` since we don't have
a lot of character space using imperative mood saves us some precious
character space.

``Update lint configuration for Molecule v3`` is better than
``Updated lint configuration for Molecule v3``.


Wrap the body at 72 characters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Git does not automatically wrap text so you must manually do this. Keeping
the limit to 72 characters is good practice to allow for Git to do indentation
and still be under 80 characters total.


Use the body to explain what and why vs. how
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Think of yourself as the reviewer of the change. If someone proposed the
change to you, what information would you like to know about it for you to
approve the review.

Reviewers can look at the diff to see what exactly was changed so focus on
telling the reviewer why they should accept your change. You are essentially
writing a proposal here.


Bad example:

.. code-block:: none

    Updated README


Good example:

.. code-block:: none

    Add section on how to contribute to the project

    Improved the README to add details on how to create a developer account
    and contribution guidelines to help new developers more easily engage
    with the project.

If you are fixing code or a test, include details on how to reproduce the
problem so that the reviewer doesn't have to reach out to you for further
details on how to retest.


Commit message footer
---------------------

The final block of a commit message is a commit message footer. Similar to
email it's where you sign off on your message as well as include other useful
metadata. Typically for references to issues or links to pages for additional
information.

Example:

.. code-block:: none

    Issue: ABC-123
    Change-Id: Iaa40ef0377409e08e6efd41aa967249f9d3c4xyz
    Co-authored-by: Bob <bob@example.com>
    Signed-off-by: Tim <tim@example.com>


Signed-off-by
-------------

You may have noticed in many open source projects folks leave a
``Signed-off-by: Firstname Lastname <someone@example.com>``.

This can be added via the ``git commit -s`` command is a convenience parameter
to automatically type it in for you but you can also type it in by hand when
writing your commit message.

Signed-off-by doesn't really mean much in most projects but some open source
projects use it as a way of indicating that you have signed off on an
official document such as a **Contributor License Agreement (CLA)** or a
**Developer Certificate of Origin**.

Reference: https://developercertificate.org/

.. code-block:: none

Poor man's automated release notes
----------------------------------

To prove a point that well defined commit messages can be useful. One way to
take advantage of a repo that follows the practice is to automate generation
of release notes with commit messages.

.. code-block:: bash

    git log --no-merges --pretty=format:"%h %<(20) %an %s" 1.0.0..2.0.0

For example the Jenkins Job Builder (JJB) project generates release notes this
way. You can reproduce one by following these steps:

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://review.opendev.org/jjb/jenkins-job-builder
    git log --no-merges --pretty=format:"%h %<(20) %an %s" 2.9.0..3.0.0

You should get something similar to this:

.. code-block:: none
    :emphasize-lines: 12, 24, 25

This has a many of the key points we are interested in a simple release notes
package.

1. Details on what changed since last release
2. Credit to the author of the change
3. A reference that can be used to get more details if necessary


Troubleshooting and debugging
-----------------------------

Commit messages are also great for quickly troubleshooting an issue if some
change broke our project in an unexpected way. If commit messages are well
formed, developers can review the git log to quickly identify which changes
may be related to the unexpected issue and narrow down the problem much more
quickly.

Referring back to the JJB project again, there was a case where a hotfix
release had to be pushed out shortly after a major release. If we take a look
at the difference between versions 2.2.0 to 2.2.1 we can see that the hotfix
release reverted a particular commit:

.. code-block:: bash

    git log --no-merges --pretty=format:"%h %<(20) %an %s" 2.2.0..2.2.1

    c33dbaaa  Thanh Ha             Revert "Allow dashes in variable key names"

After some users started deploying version 2.2.0 we quickly discovered that
folks using certain characters in their variable names. The original commit
``b92336aa  Darragh Bailey       Allow dashes in variable key names`` was
descriptive enough that allowed us to narrow down to this commit to identify
the issue and revert and release a hotfix.


Tools for commit review
-----------------------


git status
^^^^^^^^^^

The ``git status`` command is a useful command for showing the current state
of your Git directory. Showing the relation between your :term:`Worktree`.


**git status: brand new repo**

.. code-block:: none

    On branch master

    No commits yet

    nothing to commit (create/copy files and use "git add" to track)


**git status: clean worktree**

.. code-block:: none

    On branch master
    nothing to commit, working tree clean


**git status: untracked file**

.. code-block:: none

    On branch master
    Untracked files:
      (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

        abc

    nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)


**git status: modified file**

.. code-block:: none

    On branch master
    Changes not staged for commit:
      (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
      (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

        modified:   test

    no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")


**git status: staged file**

.. code-block:: none

    On branch master
    Changes to be committed:
      (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)

        new file:   abc


git log
^^^^^^^

The ``git log`` command is useful for inspecting the branch history.
This command unfortunately is only as useful as participants on the project
make it. See **The importance of a Commit Message** for best
practices on managing your commit message.

Check the log of the projects you work on often and try to see if you can
understand the progress of the project from the log. Use the following log
commands and explore the differences:

* git log
* git shortlog
* git log 1.0.0..2.0.0

Many Git commands support passing a commit range to tell Git to show you what
changes are in the 2nd reference point that's not in the 1st reference point.
What Git is doing in this case is taking the 2 commits as a starting point,
then walk through the commit history looking for a common ancestor or parent
commit. Then it uses the commit parent as the starting point of history and
returning the results from the parent commit until the 2nd reference point.

Try reversing the 2 reference points and see how the log changes.


git diff
^^^^^^^^

The ``git diff`` command is useful for checking out what changed between 2
commit points. Try the following:

* git diff
* git diff HEAD~1
* git diff origin/master
* git diff BranchA BranchB


gitk
^^^^

This is the default Git GUI that comes with standard Git. It's a powerful
GUI based viewer to allow you to see the state of the local Git repo. It's
a combination of ``git log`` and ``git diff`` put together into a single
easy to navigate viewer.

.. figure:: img/gitk.png
   :alt: gitk

Demo: Committing and amending
-----------------------------

First let's create a file that we can use to commit and amend.

.. code-block:: bash

    git status

    echo "To contribute to this project simply open a PR." > CONTRIBUTING
    git status

    git add CONTRIBUTING
    git status

    git commit

.. note::

    Avoid using ``git commit -m 'Message'``. While it may seem handy it should
    be considered a bad habit as it promotes giving little thought to the
    message. You should always edit your commit message with a proper editor.
    This gives you the time to think about your message as well as gives you
    time to enter relevant footer information to create a more complete
    message.


**Amending the commit**

.. code-block:: bash

    git status

    echo "If you need help, reach out to the #help channel." >> CONTRIBUTING
    git status

    git add CONTRIBUTING
    git status

    git commit --amend


**Signing off on your commit**

.. code-block:: bash

    git commit --amend -s

Alternatively you can manually enter the Sign-off-by line with your editor.


Commit Mesages: Key Takeaways
-----------------------------

* Make your commit messages meaningful
* Commit messages can be used to quickly diagnose issues or even automation
