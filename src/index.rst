Git, a follow along guide
#########################

Git is a distributed revision control system. At it's most basic level it
tracks the historical changes in contents of files over time.

It's distributed nature means everyone working on a project has their own
separate offline copy of all of the code allowing folks to work on the same
project in parallel.

Git is probably the single most important skill for anyone working in
technology today on any kind of collaborative project. If you are struggling
to use Git you will be limited in your ability to collaborate with others.

Throughout the course of this Guide, I hope to pass on some knowledge that
will help you more effectively use Git and hopefully be interesting to both
newbies as well as veterans of Git.
