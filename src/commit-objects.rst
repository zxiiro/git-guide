Deeper look into commits
========================

Despite being the core function of Git, folks new to Git often ignore the
importance of understanding :term:`Commit Objects <Commit object>` and how
they interact with the entire Git system.

One important overlooked feature of it is the Commit Message, often times
commits with poorly defined messages are created and submitted to Git repos
that make it difficult to later troubleshoot or sometimes automate tasks with
Git.

In this section we will take a deeper dive into Git Objects themselves as well
as explore what makes a great **Commit Message** when preparing a commit for
public review.

Writing a great commit message
------------------------------

Similar to email, a commit message has a subject line and a body which
is separated by a blank line. Do not write your entire commit message in the
subject line.

.. code-block:: none

    Subject line in 50 chars or less

    Following a blank line after the subject line is the commit message
    body, containing a more detailed explaination of the change.
    This should be word-wrapped at 72 characters.

    The body can consist of as many lines as necessary to fully
    explain in detail why the change is necessary. You should
    explain the problem that this commit is solving and focus on
    why this change is necessary rather than explaining the "how"
    (the reviewer can review the code for that detail).

    Include any side effects and consequences of the change.

    Many CLI based tools such as `git log`, `git shortlog`,
    `git rebase`, are significantly more useful when the commit
    messages follow these best practices.

    Finally the last "block" (a section without further blank spaces
    following it) is for metadata such as sign-offs, references, and
    issue numbers.

The subject line
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The subject line should be short and to the point, providing enough detail
for the reader to immediately have a decent idea about what the commit is
about.

From the ``git commit`` manpage:

    Though not required, itâ€™s a good idea to begin the commit message with a
    single short (less than 50 character) line summarizing the change,
    followed by a blank line and then a more thorough description. The text up
    to the first blank line in a commit message is treated as the commit
    title, and that title is used throughout Git. For example,
    Git-format-patch(1) turns a commit into email, and it uses the title on
    the Subject line and the rest of the commit in the body.

Best practices:

* Keep the subject line short (50 characters)
* The first letter of the subject line should be capitalized
* The subject line should not end with any punctuation
* The subject line should be written in imperative mood
* Immediately following subject line is a blank line

Good examples:

- Allow pyyaml >= 5
- Bump version to 2.0.0-SNAPSHOT
- Fix double inderection of name templates
- Add Private and WIP change support for gerrit

Bad examples:

- Add support for noSquash (no-squash) in jms-messaging trigger
  (**Subject line over 50 char**)
- Fixes delete-all command when no option is provided (**Not imperative mood**)
- Adding view for the Delivery Pipeline Plugin (**Not imperative mood**)
- test non-default value of attach-build-log (**Uncapitalized first letter**)
- Remove deprecated 'extended-choice' property. (**Ends in period**)
- Fix docs build issue (**Too vague**)


The commit body
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Following a blank line after the subject line, the commit body is where you
can explain your change in full details.

Best practices:

* Keep lines under 72 characters
* Explain what and why instead of how

Git as well many tools that parse Git commits do not automatically wrap text
so you must manually do this yourself. Keeping the limit to 72 characters is
good practice to allow for Git to do indentation and still be under 80
characters total.

Put yourself in the shoes of the reviewer of the change. If someone proposed
this change to you, what information would you like to know about it before
you will approve the change?

Reviewers can look at the diff to see what exactly was changed so focus on
telling the reviewer why they should accept your change. You are essentially
writing a project proposal here so provide as much detail as possible.

If you are fixing code or a test, include details on how to reproduce the
problem so that the reviewer doesn't have to reach out to you for further
details on how to retest.

Good example A:

.. code-block:: none

    Fix the yaml load warning

    In the new version of PyYAML the API changed to be more explicit. Now
    the default value for the Loader is None, see:

    https://github.com/yaml/pyyaml/blob/5.1/lib3/yaml/__init__.py#L103

    The load is unsafe. It's better to use safe_load function.

    Change-Id: Ia1cd16f2ff970ca220a266c99b6554dd4254ebd9

Good example B:

.. code-block:: none

    Add 'secret-token' parameter to gitlab trigger

    This adds support for the job specific secret token in the
    gitlab build trigger.

    This feature was added to the "Gitlab Plugin" with version 1.4.1
    (released Sep 24, 2016).
    Excerpt from the changelog:
     "Add possiblity to configure secret tokens per job to allow
     only web hooks with the correct token to trigger builds."

    Change-Id: Id1ede4a6a51a231f60a39bfaefbadd8f849076e4


Commit message footer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The final block of a commit message is a commit message footer. Similar to
email it's where you sign off on your message as well as include other useful
metadata. Typically for references to issues or links to pages for additional
information.

Example:

.. code-block:: none

    Issue: ABC-123
    Change-Id: Iaa40ef0377409e08e6efd41aa967249f9d3c4xyz
    Co-authored-by: Bob <bob@example.com>
    Signed-off-by: Tim <tim@example.com>

**Signed-off-by**

You may have noticed in many open source projects folks leave a
``Signed-off-by: Firstname Lastname <someone@example.com>``.

This can be added via the ``git commit -s`` command, it's a convenience
parameter to automatically type it in for you but you can also type it in by
hand when writing your commit message.

Signed-off-by doesn't really mean much in most projects but some open source
projects use it as a way of indicating that you have signed off on an
official document such as a **Contributor License Agreement (CLA)** or a
**Developer Certificate of Origin**.

Reference: https://developercertificate.org/

Final tips on commit messages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* **Resist the urge to use** ``git commit -m``

  While it may seem handy at first, it promotes a habit of writing
  unthoughtful commit messages. By editing your commit message in a full
  editor you will spend more time thinking about your commit message.

* **Spend time reviewing code yourself**

  If you are actively participating in a project, spend some time reviewing
  code on that project even if you are not a maintainer or committer on the
  project. This is the best way for you to quickly learn the best practices of
  not only the project but also what we discussed here as it is easier to
  understand the hardships of a code reviewer if you are one yourself.


Poor man's automated release notes
----------------------------------

To prove a point that well defined commit messages can be useful. One way to
take advantage of a repo that follows the best practices is to automate
generation of release notes with commit messages.

For example the Jenkins Job Builder (JJB) project generates release notes this
way. You can reproduce one by following these steps:

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://review.opendev.org/jjb/jenkins-job-builder
    git log --no-merges --pretty=format:"%h %<(20) %an %s" 2.9.0..3.0.0

You should get something similar to this:

.. code-block:: none

This has a many of the key points we are interested in a simple release notes
package:

1. Summary of what changed since last release
2. Credit to the author of the change
3. A reference that can be used to get more details if necessary


Troubleshooting and debugging
-----------------------------

Commit messages are also great for quickly troubleshooting an issue if some
change broke our project in an unexpected way. If commit messages are well
formed, developers can review the git log to quickly identify which changes
may be related to the unexpected issue and narrow down the problem much more
quickly.

Referring back to the JJB project again, there was a case where a hotfix
release had to be pushed out shortly after a major release. If we take a look
at the difference between versions 2.2.0 to 2.2.1 we can see that the hotfix
release reverted a particular commit:

.. code-block:: bash

    git log --no-merges --pretty=format:"%h %<(20) %an %s" 2.2.0..2.2.1

    c33dbaaa  Thanh Ha             Revert "Allow dashes in variable key names"

After some users started deploying version 2.2.0 we quickly discovered that
folks using certain characters in their variable names. The original commit
``b92336aa  Darragh Bailey       Allow dashes in variable key names`` was
descriptive enough that allowed us to narrow down to this commit to identify
the issue and revert and release a hotfix.


Tools for commit review
-----------------------

.. contents::
    :local:
    :depth: 1


git status
^^^^^^^^^^

The ``git status`` command is a useful command for showing the current state
of your Git directory. Showing the relation between your :term:`Worktree` and
the Local Repository.


**git status: brand new repo**

.. code-block:: none

    On branch master

    No commits yet

    nothing to commit (create/copy files and use "git add" to track)


**git status: clean worktree**

.. code-block:: none

    On branch master
    nothing to commit, working tree clean


**git status: untracked file**

.. code-block:: none

    On branch master
    Untracked files:
      (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

        abc

    nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)


**git status: modified file**

.. code-block:: none

    On branch master
    Changes not staged for commit:
      (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
      (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

        modified:   test

    no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")


**git status: staged file**

.. code-block:: none

    On branch master
    Changes to be committed:
      (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)

        new file:   abc


git log
^^^^^^^

The ``git log`` command is useful for inspecting the branch history.
This command unfortunately is only as useful as participants on the project
make it. See :ref:`commit-objects:Deeper look into commits` for best
practices on managing your commit message.

Check the log of the projects you work on often and try to see if you can
understand the progress of the project from the log. Use the following log
commands and explore the differences:

* git log
* git shortlog
* git log 1.0.0..2.0.0

Many Git commands support passing a commit range to tell Git to show you what
changes are in the 2nd reference point that's not in the 1st reference point.
What Git is doing in this case is taking the 2 commits as a starting point,
then walk through the commit history looking for a common ancestor or parent
commit. Then it uses the commit parent as the starting point of history and
returning the results from the parent commit until the 2nd reference point.

Try reversing the 2 reference points and see how the log changes.


git diff
^^^^^^^^

The ``git diff`` command is useful for checking out what changed between 2
commit points. Try the following:

* git diff
* git diff HEAD~1
* git diff origin/master
* git diff BranchA BranchB


gitk
^^^^

This is the default Git GUI that comes with standard Git. It's a powerful
GUI based viewer to allow you to see the state of the local Git repo. It's
a combination of ``git log`` and ``git diff`` put together into a single
easy to navigate viewer.

.. figure:: img/gitk.png
   :alt: gitk

   gitk - Graphical history viewer


History of specific path
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Many Git commands support the ability to look up the history of specific
paths. Whether it be a directory or individual files.

* gitk -- README
* gitk -- src/
* git diff -- README
* git log -- src/

The ``--`` is necessary if you are looking for details on a path that was
removed from current commits.


Commit ranges
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Many Git commands also support the ability to pass ranges using ``from..to``
notation. This is useful if you want to know what's different between 2
branches.

**Double dot notation** The double dot notation tells Git to show you only
commits that are in the 2nd parameter that is not common to both.

**Triple dot notation** The triple dot notation tells Git to show you commits
from both parameters that are not common.

.. figure:: img/git-branch-basic.png
   :alt: Git history with work branch

   Git history with work branch

Examples:

* gitk 1.0..2.0
* git log --no-merges --pretty=format:"%h %<(20) %an %s" 2.2.0..2.2.1


Demo: Committing and amending
-----------------------------

First let's create a file that we can use to commit and amend.

.. code-block:: bash

    git status

    echo "To contribute to this project simply open a PR." > CONTRIBUTING
    git status

    git add CONTRIBUTING
    git status

    git commit

.. note::

    Avoid using ``git commit -m 'Message'``. While it may seem handy it should
    be considered a bad habit as it promotes giving little thought to the
    message. You should always edit your commit message with a proper editor.
    This gives you the time to think about your message as well as gives you
    time to enter relevant footer information to create a more complete
    message.


**Amending the commit**

.. code-block:: bash

    git status

    echo "If you need help, reach out to the #help channel." >> CONTRIBUTING
    git status

    git add CONTRIBUTING
    git status

    git commit --amend


**Signing off on your commit**

.. code-block:: bash

    git commit --amend -s

Alternatively you can manually enter the Sign-off-by line with your editor.


Commit Mesages: Key Takeaways
-----------------------------

* Make your commit messages meaningful
* Commit messages can be used to quickly diagnose issues or even automation
